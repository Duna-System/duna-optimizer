# Moptimizer - A C++ Non linear optimization library

This library is a _simple_ non-linear optimization library. It was initially made to
learn and experiment non-linear programming but can be useful for simple purposes.

## Architectural Overview

## Usage

## Roadmap
- Make use of Manifold Space parameters
- GPU programming (CUDA + Thrust)
